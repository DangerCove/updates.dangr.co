### Added

* Download/purchase receipt verification has been added.

### Changed

* The copy of the Tip Jar and Release Notes screen has a few minor changes.
* Some under the hood changes.

### Removed

* I've removed the in-app feedback option. The platform I'm using for that [is retiring the service](https://announcement.devmate.com). If you need to reach me, head over to the [support page](https://support.dangercove.com).
