### Fixed

* Tweaked CSS to accommodate Carbon 4.1.8 changes.

Carbon.now.sh updated their UI, which caused Carbonize to hide the theme dropdown. Sorry for the inconvenience. I'm working on an offline-mode that will help prevent these bugs in the future.

[Leaving a positive review](http://dangercove.com/carbonize/appstore) on the Mac App Store helps others discover Carbonize as well. It's much appreciated! ðŸ™‚
