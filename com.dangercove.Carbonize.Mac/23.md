title: Re-introduce Crash Reporter
layout: page
---

### Added

* A brand new Crash Reporter! To replace the one that came with DevMate.
* Anonymous 'app open' and device statistics reporting.

The number of people using the app, together with device statistics and crash reports allow me to better respond to problems and set priorities for future updates.

### Changed

* I've switched to a new versioning system. This is version 2020.1, which means it was released in 2020 and this is the first update of that year.
* Updated dependencies.
