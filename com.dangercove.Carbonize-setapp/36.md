This is the biggest update to ~~Carbonize~~ **Petrify** since it launched! With a new name comes an editor that works completely offline.

### Changed

* Carbonize is now **Petrify**.
* The editor works completely **offline**.
* The design of the editor better fits the application window.

Note: if you want to migrate your settings and themes to the updated editor, use the Migrator in Preferences.

### Added

* A migrator to move settings and themes from the previous, online editor over to the new offline version.

### Removed

* Unsplash background images. The updated, offline editor currently does not support automatic images through Unsplash.
* Adding background images through a link.
