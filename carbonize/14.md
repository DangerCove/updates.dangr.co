### Changed

* I've introduced a more personal and relatable take on the Tip Jar. You can now buy me edibles instead of 'jars of love' and I've included a picture of me. ðŸ˜„

### Fixed

* The tip buttons can now be reached by using the keyboard only, using Tab.
* Fixed a retain cycle that could lead to extra memory usage.
