### Changed

* * I've introduced a more personal take on the Tip Jar. The 'jars of love' have been replaced by edibles and I've included a picture of myself. ðŸ˜„

### Fixed

* The tip buttons can now be reached by using the keyboard only, using Tab.
* Fixed a retain cycle that could lead to extra memory usage.
