_Version 1.2.1 is a quick bug fix update that fixes a crash that could occur when using the Share menu._

It also adds hover states for the Export menu and enables the Undo/Redo buttons in the menu for text changes.

### Added

* A standard Toolbar with a new Export Menu.
* Option to export images using a regular Save Panel. ðŸ’¾
* A Sharing Service Picker to easily copy your images into apps you use often.
* Export keyboard shortcut: **âŒ˜ + E**
* The option to clear image cache. (The Floating Window caches the exported image on disk.)
* Optional automatic image cache clearing on quit. (Enabled by default.)
* This Release Notes window. ðŸ˜„

### Changed

* There's a brand new Export Menu that allows you to choose between two different export options:
  * The Floating Window that you're familiar with. ðŸ‘»
  * A standard Save Panel that will just save the file where you want.
* I've grouped together the items in Preferences in separate categories.

### Removed

* The Tweet button used the Carbon API behind the scenes. It wasn't working as reliable as I wanted it to and I decided to remove the Tweet button for now. ðŸ—‘
